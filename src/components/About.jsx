                        Peaceful Unicorn is a blockchain-empowered metaverse creation project that aims to promote awareness, charitable donations and community engagement to critical social and environmental issues. This can be achieved through donation-gamification and community engagement within our Peaceful Unicorn Metaverse. Our target customers have altruistic mindset and care about the sustainable living more than the average person, they have knowledge or are interested in participating in the metaverse that will have a direct impact in the real world we live in.
